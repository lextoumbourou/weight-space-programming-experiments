## Step 31: probe |x5|, |x10| and |x11| together

**What step 30 showed**
- Adding |x2|, |x3| and |x8| at 0.5 each raised the loss by about 0.006 over the expected baseline of about 0.490.
- That is less than the cost of three irrelevant terms, so none of these three has a nonlinear effect.

**This step**
- I keep x6 at −0.45 and the main four features unchanged.
- I probe the remaining features in the same way: |x5|, |x10| and |x11|, each at +0.5, with the bias kept centred.
- After this, |x6| is the only magnitude term left untested (|x0| was checked in step 15). I can cover it with one more step if needed.
